-------------MICROSERVICES Notes-----------------

It is an architecture that organizes computer systems into services that can be scaled in future on demand. Monolith architecture is when create one big huge heavy application and deploy multiple instances of it. In microservice architect you build small independent services. 

-------------Spring Notes-----------------------

FOUNDER - Rod Johnson
JAVA EE (Enterprise edition) is an enhanced version of JAVA SE (Standard edition) for web services and distributed computing
Spring 5 was released in in september 2017
Spring is more popular than ealier version of J2EE as it was slow due to EJB and complex configurations

* Things needed to run spring 5 application: 
	1. YOU NEED JDK (not  JRE) that supports JAVA 8 or higher for spring 5
	2. Java application server like Tomcat
	3. IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ
	4. For compiling and running the application you need the spring 5 jars to be present on your classpath in your IDE.

** Tutorials point **
Spring is the most popular application development framework for enterprise Java. Millions of developers around the world use Spring Framework to create high performing, easily testable, and reusable code. Spring framework is an open source Java platform. It was initially written by Rod Johnson and was first released under the Apache 2.0 license in June 2003.

To make a class a controller just add annotation @RestController
TO make a method an endpoint add @GetMapping("/your_endpoint")

-------------Spring Security-----------------------

Granted authorities can be named anything we want
roles should always be prefixed by "ROLE_" in spring security

* Servlet can be described in many ways, depending on the context.

Servlet is a technology which is used to create a web application.
Servlet is an API that provides many interfaces and classes including documentation.
Servlet is an interface that must be implemented for creating any Servlet.
Servlet is a class that extends the capabilities of the servers and responds to the incoming requests. It can respond to any requests.
Servlet is a web component that is deployed on the server to create a dynamic web page.

* Filters are common in servlet functionality. The path in url determines which servlet should(a class which will give some response) the request go to. Filters intercept every request and approve / deny requests as per information passed in headers / url, like authentication and auth filters required for all incoming requests.

* Authentication is configured using AuthenticationManager of spring security which has a method authenticate which returns true false

* To configure security define a class and extend WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter. Then override configure method by passing AuthenticationManagerBuilder to it.

* For password encoding: declare a @Bean PasswordEncoder. Spring is looking at all beans will find BCrypt bean and hash passwords

* for Authentication override config(AuthManBuilder)
* for Authoriation override config(HttpSecurity) Chaining method is used, from most restrictive to least restrictive
* In an application there can be multiple AuthenticationProvider doing different auth lke LDAP, Username/Password, based
* An AuthenticationManager can have multiple AuthenticationProvider. It chooses one among then for auth
* AuthenticationProvider uses userDetailsService to load user details 

--------------------JDK vs JRE-------------------
The JRE is the Java Runtime Environment. It is a package of everything necessary to run a compiled Java program, including the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), the Java Class Library, the java command, and other infrastructure. However, it cannot be used to create new programs.

The JDK is the Java Development Kit, the full-featured SDK for Java. It has everything the JRE has, but also the compiler (javac) and tools (like javadoc and jdb). It is capable of creating and compiling programs.

Usually, if you only care about running Java programs on computer you will only install the JRE. It's all you need. On the other hand, if you are planning to do some Java programming, you need to install the JDK instead.

Sometimes, even if you are not planning to do any Java development on a computer, you still need the JDK installed. For example, if you are deploying a web application with JSP, you are technically just running Java programs inside the application server. Why would you need the JDK then? Because the application server will convert JSP into Java servlets and needs to use the JDK to compile the servlets. I am sure there are be more examples.

* EJB - Enterprise Java Beans

------Spring Security Tutorial------------------

It is an application level security which takes care of authentication and authorization. Like to protect an api endpoint against unauthorized users. Allow/block access to URLs to loggedin users and with certain roles.
Things spring security provides security on following levels:
1. Username / password authentication
2. SSO / okta LDAP
3. App level authorization
4. Intra App auth like O AUTH
5. Microservice security using JWT
6. METHOD LEVEL SECURITY

5 terms frequemtly used: Authentication(Who you are), Authorization(Do you have access to this resource), Principal (Currently logged in user), Granted authority(Different Accesses/Authorities with principal), Role(Group of Authorities)

** How to add spring security to spring boot app?
In pom.xml add apring-boot-starter-security dependency. It adds a filter instantly for all controller and all methods. 
Default behaviour: 
	1. as soon as you add spring security as dependency and restart app, it adds mandatory authentication to all your endpoints if not otherwise configured. ie, creates a filter for all endpoints and all methods
	2. Adds a login form
	3. Handles login error
	4. Generates a new user and default password each time we start the app, logged in console of the app

** How to configure authentication in spring security:
We configure AuthenticationManagerBuilder: 
	1. create a class Security configuration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter
	2. Add annotation EnableWebSecurity
	3. Expose a bean with annotation @Bean 

** How to configure authorization in spring security: (It is a method chaining of all endpoints)
We configure HttpSecurity:
	1. use http.authorizeRequests().antMatchers().hasRole("ROLE_NAME") or hasAnyRole("ROLE_1","ROLE_2")
	2. We write rules in such a way that most restrictive is defined  first, least restrictive ones follow.
